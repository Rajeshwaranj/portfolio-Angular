# Personal website for introduce yourself

## Getting Started

I have developed this theme as a personal proyect. 
Because I'm not a ReactJS expert (language of the Britanny's proyect), and I liked so much the design, I decided to develop this project with Angular's architecture. The website is not connected to any api yet, nither it has dynamic content so that all the content is static inside the HTML files in Angular. I want to connect it to an API in the future, from where i can manage in an easy way without having touch the HTML files in angular.



``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing

Just clone  the repo and excecute the following command inside the folder proyect

``` bash
npm install
```

### All done!!

Now just run
```
npm start
```
Wait to compile and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) after compile finish
